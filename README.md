# Solar Savers üåû 

A dashboard application helping Canadian homeowners in solar panel purchasing decisions.

## Our Purpose 

#### ‚ùå The Problem

The global need to shift towards sustainable energy sources has been recognized for decades, but its urgency continues to escalate. At the consumer-level, this problem is compounded by the rise in inflation and challenging decisions required when purchasing items like solar panels.

#### ‚úÖ Our Solution
With this escalating inflation and growing environmental consciousness, consumers across Canada seek to save money where they can. Solar Savers, a user-friendly app, is designed to better equip homeowners in the decision-making process of purchasing solar panels for their home. With user's location, electricity rates, and panel quality, Solar Savers allows users to see their potential electricity and financial savings. It provides the required knowledge to assess the value of investing in solar panels and facilitates the decision-making process overall.
